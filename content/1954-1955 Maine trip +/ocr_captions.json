      "caption_text": "Our quiet life is disrupted on Tuesday, August 31, when we are lashed by the tail of hurricane 'Carol' which veers inland from the Atlantic killing 50 to 60 people in the Boston-Providence area. A number of trees go down around us and limbs are shorn off. We go to bed Tuesday night with the wind howling and not knowing when a tree might crash our cottage. Luckily, we escaped untouched.\n\nThe hurrriicccanne klooks out both our elecceecccriccccciiiittty and our water supply for the duration of our stay at Pemaquid.\n\nOur placid pond looks like a miniature ocean at the height of the hurricane.\n\nBelow - the next morning the children examine the damage."
